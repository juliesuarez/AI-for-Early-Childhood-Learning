# ParentPal AI ü§ñ

ParentPal AI is a web application designed to solve SDG's. It serves as an AI-powered assistant for parents, providing simple, actionable advice and learning modules on early childhood education.

# The Core Feature

A parent can select their child's age and a topic of interest (e.g., "Language Development"). The application then leverages a generative AI to provide a concise learning tip and a fun, practical activity the parent can do with their child.

# Tech Stack

# Backend: Python with the Flask micro-framework.
# AI: Google's Gemini API (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`).
# Payments:Stripe API for handling credit pack purchases.
# Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
# Deployment:Render (PaaS).
